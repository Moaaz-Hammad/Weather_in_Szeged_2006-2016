# Weather_in_Szeged_2006-2016

This project is a model that can predict Temperature given the humidity.

Steps:

1- Importing the necessary library

2- Importing Dataset

2.1- Info about data

3-Data Cleaning & Pre-processing

3.1- Dealing with Missing Data

3.2- Drop the columns that I don't need

5-Exploratory Data Analysis

6- Building Our Model

6.1- Define X and Y

6.2- Train / Test Split Data

6.3- Model Training and Predicting

6.4- Model Evaluation

Tools I used:

1- Linear Regression to predict the Temperature of the data.

2- r2_score to get the evaluation of outputs.

3- Mean_absolute_error to find the error rate.

4- Pandas

5- Numpy

6- Matplotlib

7- Seaborn
