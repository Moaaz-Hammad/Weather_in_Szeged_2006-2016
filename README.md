# 🌦️ Szeged Weather Analysis (2006-2016)

A data science project analyzing 10 years of weather patterns in Szeged, Hungary, using machine learning to predict temperatures!

## 🌟 About The Project

This project analyzes weather data from Szeged, Hungary, spanning from 2006 to 2016. We use machine learning to understand weather patterns and predict temperatures based on various weather conditions.

## 🎯 What We Can Predict

Our model can predict temperature based on:
- 🌡️ Apparent Temperature
- 💧 Humidity
- 💨 Wind Speed
- 🧭 Wind Direction
- 👀 Visibility
- ⏲️ Air Pressure

## ✨ Key Features

- Temperature prediction with 98.99% accuracy
- Mean Absolute Error of only 0.74°C
- Beautiful data visualizations
- Comprehensive weather pattern analysis

## 📊 Data Insights

Our analysis includes:
- Distribution of weather parameters
- Correlation between different weather conditions
- Seasonal patterns and trends
- Temperature variations throughout the years

## 🎨 Visualizations
